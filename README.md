JJ is a remote HTTP mock library that simulates HTTP responses for incoming requests. It enables users to define conditions for incoming HTTP requests and specify the responses that should be returned. The library operates on a client-server architecture, allowing for the server to be run locally or deployed remotely, catering to diverse testing environments.

## Features
- **Flexible Request Matching**: Define complex conditions to match incoming HTTP requests.
- **Customizable Responses**: Tailor responses to suit your testing needs.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Run your mock server locally or deploy it remotely.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Modify mocking behavior on-the-fly without server restarts.
